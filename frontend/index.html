        <h1>SafeElimination</h1>
        <p>
            Two players are chosen randomly from the group. 
            One player will know the status (safe or eliminated) and the other will try to guess it by asking questions.
            Player B also has the option to steal the card
        </p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>

        <h4>Selecting Players</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> At the start of each round, the facilitator randomly selects two players from the group.</li>
            <li>One of the two selected players is randomly chosen to view the card.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Questioning Phase</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>The player who did not see the card (Player B) starts asking questions to the player who saw the card (Player A).</li>
            <li>The questioning phase lasts for a predetermined number of questions</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Decision Phase</h4>
        <p>After the questioning phase, Player B must decide whether to steal the card or not.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If Player B steals the card:
                <ul>
                    <li>If it’s a Safe card, Player B remains in the game, and Player A is safe for this round.</li>
                    <li>If it’s an Elimination card, Player B is eliminated from the game.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If Player B does not steal the card:
                <ul>
                    <li>If it’s a Safe card, both players remain in the game.</li>
                    <li>If it’s an Elimination card, Player A is eliminated from the game.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Winning the Game</h4>
